Statements of the author

My statements are:

* The TextFactory does not manage files in your Google Drive.

    * Sure, it is an add-on of the Google docs.

* The TextFactory does not run when you are not present.

* The TextFactory does not connect to any extenal service. All the source codes are hosted by the Google Doc's add-on system. And all the communication goes between your browser and Google Docs server.

    * One suspecious reason for this warnning message is that for getting Hebrew date, it requests Heberw calendar from \ |LINK1|\
